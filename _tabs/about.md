Hi 👋,

I'm **Vu** (pronounced like "Voo"), a software engineer with a passion for solving problems and optimizing/automating things.

This devblog is a collection of my random thoughts and experiments, and a place to share my learnings, mostly about Python and backend stuff. All posts will be originated from my personal experiences, and I will try not to regurgitate the same content from the Internet.

I'm not a big writer, even more so when talking about myself. So I'll let the content speak for itself 😶‍🌫️.
